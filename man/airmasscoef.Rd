\title{Calculates the airmass coefficient}
\usage{
airmasscoef(localtime, lat, long, julian, merid = 0, dst = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{localtime}{local time (decimal hour, 24 hour clock).}

\item{lat}{latitude of the location for which the airmass coefficient is required (decimal degrees, -ve south of equator).}

\item{long}{longitude of the location for which the airmass coefficient is required (decimal degrees, -ve west of Greenwich meridian).}

\item{julian}{a numeric value representing the Julian day as returned by \code{\link[=julday]{julday()}}.}

\item{merid}{an optional numeric value representing the longitude (decimal degrees) of the local time zone meridian (0 for UK time).}

\item{dst}{an optional numeric value representing the local summer time adjustment (hours, e.g. +1 for BST).}
}
\value{
the airmass coefficient, i.e. the direct optical path length of a solar beam through the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, expressed as a ratio relative to the path length vertically upwards for a given location and time.
}
\description{
\code{airmasscoef} is used to calculate, for a given location and time, the direct optical path length of a solar beam through the atmosphere of the Earth, expressed as a ratio relative to the path length vertically upwards.

# airmass coefficient at noon on 21 June 2010, Porthleven, Cornwall
jd <- julday (2010, 6, 21) # Julian day
